CSS Transitions and Pseudo-classes

Task: Create a simple navigation menu. When a user hovers over each menu item, apply a smooth transition effect,
such as a color change or scaling, using CSS transitions. Additionally, use pseudo-classes like :hover and :active 
to enhance the interactive experience.
